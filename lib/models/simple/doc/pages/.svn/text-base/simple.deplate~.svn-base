* Description of the model

This is a simple document model for ''dokkit''. You can use this model
as a base to create simple documents like tutorials, howtos, technical
reports, etc.

* Edit and render your document

To edit the content of the document simply edit
''simpledocument.deplate'' in ''doc/pages'' folder or create a new
file in ''doc/pages'' directory.

To get further information about the deplate wiki syntax please check
[[http://deplate.sf.net/deplate.html][deplate]] homepage.

To render this document in ''html'', ''tex'' and ''plain text'', open a terminal and type:

#Verbatim <<EOB
$ dokkit ## or rake
EOB

from the top-level directory or from any subdirectory contained in it.
  
You should get the output files in the 'output' folder.

* Rendering the modified parts of the document and cleaning up

Once you have rendered the document, running the ''dokkit'' command again will
appear to do nothing, because only changed resources are re-rendered.
To clean the output and start over run:

#Verbatim <<EOB
$ dokkit clobber
EOB

Note that if you modify any part of the document then you must re-run
''dokkit'' command in order to apply changes and to re-generate the
desidered output. 

So, once you have modified your document, run:

#Verbatim <<EOB
$ dokkit ## or rake
EOB

Only the modified resources will be transformed.

* Configure the documentation environment

To configure your documentation environment edit the *.rake files in
''tasks'' folder.

* How to get other ''dokkit'' models

To search for other document models open a terminal and type:

#Verbatim <<EOB
$ gem list dokkit-model
EOB

To get a particular model named <model_name> run:

#Verbatim <<EOB
$ gem install dokkit-model-<model_name>
EOB

or check http://rubyforge.org/projects/dokkit/. 

* What's next?

 * See what else you can do by typing:

   ''$ dokkit --tasks''


 - Modify the configuration of the document by editing
   ''doc/config/simpledocument.yaml''.

 - Override the default layout creating in custom layouts in ''doc/layouts''.
