#LIST: toc

* Description of the model

The simple model is built-in in the ''dokkit'' core distribution. You
can use this model as a base to create simple documents like static
websites, tutorials, howtos, technical reports, etc.

* Edit and render your document

To edit the content of the document simply edit ''simple.deplate'' in
the ''doc/pages'' folder or create a new file in the ''doc/pages''
directory.

To get further information about the deplate wiki syntax used in
''simple.deplate'', please check
[[http://deplate.sf.net/deplate.html][deplate]] homepage.

To render this document in ''html'', ''latex'' and ''plain text'',
open a terminal and type:

#Verbatim <<EOB
rake
EOB

from the top-level directory or from any subdirectory contained in it.
  
You should get output files in the ''output'' folder.

* Rendering the modified parts of the document and cleaning up

Once you have rendered the document, running the ''rake'' command
again will appear to do nothing, because only changed resources are
re-rendered.  To clean the output and start over run:

#Verbatim <<EOB
rake clobber
EOB

Note that if you modify any part of the document you must re-run
''rake'' command in order to apply changes and to re-generate the
desidered output.

So, once you have modified your document, run:

#Verbatim <<EOB
rake
EOB

Only the modified resources will be transformed.

* Configure the documentation environment

To configure your documentation environment edit the
''setup/setup.rb'' file according to the instructions on ''dokkit''
website.

* What's next?

 - See what else you can do by typing:

#Verbatim <<EOB
rake --tasks
EOB

 - Modify the configuration of the document by editing
   ''doc/configs/simple.yaml'' or by editing the meta configuration
   information on the top of this file.

 - Override the default layout creating custom layouts in ''doc/layouts''.
